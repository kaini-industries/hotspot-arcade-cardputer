# Hotspot Arcade — M5Stack Cardputer

[![CI](https://github.com/kaini-industries/hotspot-arcade-cardputer/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kaini-industries/hotspot-arcade-cardputer/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/kaini-industries/hotspot-arcade-cardputer?sort=semver)](https://github.com/kaini-industries/hotspot-arcade-cardputer/releases/latest)

Several offline party games your guests play from their phones. The Cardputer opens a WiFi
access point and a captive portal, everyone joins and plays in the browser — no app
to install — and the Cardputer's own screen is the host: lobby, game picker,
scoreboard, event log.

This is the Kaini Industries maintained fork of
[genkigenki/hotspot-arcade-cardputer](https://github.com/genkigenki/hotspot-arcade-cardputer),
the original Cardputer host port of
[tarikbc/hotspot-arcade](https://github.com/tarikbc/hotspot-arcade). The original
port and upstream engine/client/content attribution are retained.

If you have a Flipper, use upstream — it is the original and it is excellent.

## Screenshots

**Phone game client** — the web app your guests open in the browser: pick a nickname and an emoji avatar, then play. Same client for every game.

**On the Cardputer** — the host's own screen (captured straight off the device): the live dashboard, the game picker, and the settings screen with the per-device language switch.

## Install

**Easiest install** (Recommended): The app is in the "M5Burner" catalog and in "Launcher's" catalog. Search for "Hotspot Arcade".

**Manual install**: Flash by hand to 0x170000: 
```bash
esptool --chip esp32s3 --port COM7 --baud 921600 write_flash 0x170000 hotspot-arcade-cardputer.ino.bin
```
or you can drop the `.bin` on the microSD and launch it from the launcher.

The Cardputer's stock M5Launcher layout puts
loaded apps in `ota_0` at `0x170000` and keeps the launcher itself in the test
partition. Writing only the app image leaves the launcher untouched — you still get
back into it the usual way, by holding the button at boot.

**Full install** (replaces everything, launcher included):

```bash
esptool --chip esp32s3 --port COM7 --baud 921600 write_flash 0x0 hotspot-arcade-cardputer.full.bin
```

Replace `COM7` with your port (`/dev/ttyACM0`, `/dev/cu.usbmodem*`). `esptool` comes
with the esp32 core, or `pip install esptool`. If the board does not enter download
mode by itself, hold **G0** on the StampS3 while plugging in USB-C.

Both images are on the [releases page](../../releases). 

## Hardware

Cardputer **v1** (StampS3: ESP32-S3FN8, 8MB flash, no PSRAM). Firmware is ~1.2MB of
a 3.3MB app slot and ~78KB of static RAM, leaving ~250KB free at runtime.

Not tested on the Cardputer ADV. It should build, but the ADV has a different
keyboard controller (TCA8418) and antenna, so treat it as unverified.

Limit: the v1's antenna is weak — eight phones in a room is fine, range is worse than a dev board with an
external antenna. 

## Using it

The AP comes up at boot; there is no start step. Phones join **Hotspot Arcade** (open)
and land on `http://192.168.4.1` (if not automatically getting there via captive portal).

The dashboard is the host view: SSID and IP, whether the AP is up, the active game,
the live scoreboard, and the last event. Everything else is one key away.

| key | |
| --- | --- |
| `G` | select game (arrow keys move, `Enter` picks, `Esc` backs out) |
| `L` | full leaderboard |
| `C` | event log |
| `R` | reset scores |
| `E` | end the current round |
| `N` | rename the AP (restarts it, which drops every phone) |
| `P` | stop / start the AP |
| `Esc` | back to the dashboard |

Serial at 115200 prints the AP address, asset counts and free heap at boot.

Games: trivia, would-you-rather, word scramble, spectrum, kiss marry kill, reaction duel,
connect four, tic-tac-toe, dots & boxes, reversi, drawing, pong, guess the color,
battleship, chess — fifteen in all. Every one is phone-driven; the host picks which is
live and watches.

## Build

Needs `node` and `arduino-cli`.

```bash
tools/build.sh --deps
```

`--deps` installs esp32 core 3.3.11 and the M5Cardputer library (which pulls
M5Unified and M5GFX); drop it after the first run. The FQBN matters:

```
esp32:esp32:m5stack_cardputer:FlashSize=8M,PartitionScheme=default_8MB
```

The board's *default* partition scheme is the 4MB one with a 1.2MB app slot, which
this firmware does not fit in.

## How it relates to upstream

| | upstream (Flipper + ESP board) | here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| game engine | `esp32/hotspot-arcade-fw/ha_games.h` | the same file, unmodified |
| phone client | streamed over UART at session start | baked into flash |
| content packs | read off the Flipper's SD, streamed | baked into flash |
| host reports | UART v2 frames (`docs/PROTOCOL.md`) | same, but simply called in-process |
| host UI | Flipper scenes, 128×64 mono | `ha_ui.h`, 240×135 colour + keyboard |

The engine reaches its host through six sink functions. This port implements them as direct calls into a local mirror.

New code lives in four files under `hotspot-arcade-cardputer/`:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `hotspot-arcade-cardputer.ino` | AP, captive portal, WebSocket, the six sinks |
| `ha_ui.h` | five screens + keyboard |
| `ha_host.h` | roster / score / event mirror |
| `ha_content.h` | baked-pack parser (a port of upstream's `content_stream_pack()`) |

## Staying in sync

**The rule: nothing under `vendor/` is edited here.** Everything in it is
upstream's, copied verbatim, with the exact commit pinned in [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md).
Want a game changed? Change it upstream — then both projects get it.

```bash
node tools/sync-upstream.mjs ../hotspot-arcade   # refresh vendor/ + re-pin the commit
node tools/gen-assets.mjs                        # re-bake into the sketch
```

`git diff vendor/` after a sync is exactly the upstream change. `gen-assets.mjs`
copies the three engine headers into the sketch folder because arduino-cli builds
from a copy of the sketch directory, so an include reaching outside it would not
resolve — those copies are generated and carry a banner saying so.

## Distribution

Release publication is intentionally frozen while the `v0.6.0` safety and
reproducibility gates are assembled. The release workflow is manual-only and
does not build, tag, upload, publish, or read publishing secrets. Do not create
new release tags until the complete release gate lands.

Existing releases and catalog entries remain available, but this branch does
not mutate them. `tools/m5burner_post.py` is the fail-closed publisher that the
final gated workflow will invoke.

## Status

Unverified: the Cardputer ADV, and long sessions with many many phones.
